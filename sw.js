/* Service worker for the "Flextext Researcher" PWA — DELIBERATELY NOT OFFLINE-CACHED (2026-08-31).
 *
 * Seth: "Our researcher panel really kind of doesn't need to be aggressively cached offline the
 * way the fieldworker apps do. In fact, that's almost counter productive. Pretty much everything
 * you can do with the researcher panel depends on an internet connection."
 *
 * He is right, and this file used to be the cost with no purchaser: auth is Google OIDC, every
 * read is a worker poll, every act is a worker call, and the panel deliberately persists no
 * decrypted state — so offline, a precached shell rendered a sign-in it could not complete.
 * Meanwhile the precache made this satellite one of the deploy-order outage surfaces (the
 * editor-engine SHELL), re-downloaded the entire engine on every version bump, and kept stale
 * panels running against a newer worker — the exact opposite of what an online console wants.
 * The freshest possible panel is the safest possible panel.
 *
 * WHAT THIS WORKER NOW DOES:
 *   · intercepts NAVIGATIONS ONLY — network first, and if the network is unreachable it serves
 *     the branded offline page INLINED below (versioned with this file; no cache store at all);
 *   · does not touch any other request — scripts, styles and API calls go to the network natively,
 *     with the estate's normal HTTP caching (do not "help" by adding no-store headers);
 *   · on activate, DELETES every flextext-researcher-* cache and claims clients, so panels
 *     installed under the old precaching worker actually let go of it (the service-worker-ghost
 *     lesson: without the takeover, this change would only ever reach new installs).
 *
 * ⚠ The FIELDWORKER apps (editor, recorder, crowd, PAT) keep their offline-first workers — offline
 * is their reason to exist. This file is the researcher console only.
 *
 * ⚠ VERSION/ENGINE below are kept as inert constants ON PURPOSE: bump-version.sh syncs them and
 * test/version-sync.test.mjs asserts the five sites agree, and a bump is still what makes this
 * file byte-different so installed copies fetch the new worker. Nothing here caches by them. */

const VERSION = 'v597';
const ENGINE = 'v597';   // editor ENGINE_VERSION this was built against — must match; see version-sync test

/* ⚠ LEGACY-ORIGIN KILL SWITCH (2026-08-17) — GitHub Pages only.
 *
 * THIS FILE SHIPS TO BOTH ESTATES: apps/researcher/build.sh copies this folder into the Cloudflare
 * deployment, so an unconditional kill switch here would break https://research.flextext.app/.
 * The hostname test is what lets one file serve both, like index.html's redirect.
 *
 * On rulingants.github.io this worker stops being an app worker: it unregisters itself, drops its
 * own caches, and navigates any open window to the Cloudflare researcher — so an installed legacy
 * copy hands over on the FIRST launch after this ships rather than the second, which is what makes
 * the move invisible ("Ideally it silently redirects him so that he doesn't even notice").
 *
 * ⚠⚠ THE LINE THAT PROTECTS THE PAIRED EDITOR: the cache filter stays scoped to
 * 'flextext-researcher-*'. Three PWAs share ONE origin and ONE CacheStorage here, so the broad
 * filter used by paragraph-analysis/shell.js (delete everything that is not mine) would delete the
 * EDITOR's and RECORDER's complete caches and brick a field device offline. Same reason this file
 * never touches localStorage or IndexedDB, which are per-ORIGIN and therefore shared. Scope is also
 * why this cannot reach /flextext-editor/ at all: a worker only controls its own path.

/* The offline page, INLINED so it ships inside the worker the browser already stores: no cache
 * store, no install-time fetch, versioned with this file, cannot go stale independently.
 * Bilingual like the staging ribbon; single-theme on purpose (it commits to the panel's own look),
 * so background and every color are painted explicitly. */
